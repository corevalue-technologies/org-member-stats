## Getting Started

First for this you have to generate your Personal Access Token. Look [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) for guide. Then just copy and paste your access token in `src/main.js` <b>line no. 16</b>.
Its just a try-out project and uses only corevalue as an organization for now.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
